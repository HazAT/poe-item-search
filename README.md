# PoE Item Search

Paste your item from ingame into the input field and press enter to search for it

## Installation

- Download ZIP from Repo and extract (click on the green Code button on the top right)
- Open Chrome and go to chrome://extensions
- Click "Load unpacked"
- Select the folder you extracted
- Visit https://www.pathofexile.com/trade or https://www.pathofexile.com/trade2 and paste an item into the search field

## TODOs

- Add support for implicit attributes
- Add support for item classes
- Add support for other languages than English

## Known issues

- Armour, Energy Shield, Accuracy, and probably other attributes are added twice to the search query because they are multiple times in stats.json
