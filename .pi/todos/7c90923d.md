Plan: .pi/plans/2026-02-08-reorder-bookmarks.md

## Task
1. Add `onMoveUp?` and `onMoveDown?` optional props to `SearchEntry` component
2. Render ChevronUpIcon/ChevronDownIcon buttons in SearchEntry's hover actions (before the delete button) when props are provided
3. In `BookmarkFolder` component, add up/down arrow buttons to folder hover group (before edit button)
4. In `BookmarkTrade` rendering within `BookmarkFolder`, pass `onMoveUp`/`onMoveDown` to SearchEntry, hiding arrows for first/last items
5. For folders, hide up arrow on first visible folder, down arrow on last visible folder — pass index and isFirst/isLast from BookmarksTab

## Files
- src/components/shared/SearchEntry.tsx (modify)
- src/components/bookmarks/BookmarksTab.tsx (modify)

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Folder hover shows up/down arrows that reorder folders
- [ ] Trade hover shows up/down arrows that reorder trades within folder
- [ ] First item has no up arrow, last item has no down arrow
- [ ] Arrows only appear on hover like other action buttons
