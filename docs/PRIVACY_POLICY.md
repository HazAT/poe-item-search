# Privacy Policy for PoE Item Search

**Last updated:** January 2026

## Overview

PoE Item Search is a browser extension that helps Path of Exile players search for items on the official trade website. This privacy policy explains what data we collect and how we use it.

## Data We Collect

### Anonymous User Identifier
- We generate a random anonymous ID (UUID) stored locally in your browser
- This ID contains no personal information and cannot identify you
- It helps us track error patterns across sessions to improve the extension

### Game Item Data
- When you paste an item or copy an item from search results, the item text may be logged
- This is Path of Exile game data (item names, stats, modifiers) - not personal information
- We use this to understand how the extension is used and to debug issues

### Error and Performance Data
- Technical error information (stack traces, error messages)
- Browser type and extension version
- This helps us identify and fix bugs

## Data We Do NOT Collect

- Personal information (name, email, address)
- Browsing history outside of pathofexile.com/trade
- Account credentials or payment information
- Any data from other websites or tabs

## How We Use Your Data

All collected data is used solely to:
- Fix bugs and errors in the extension
- Improve extension functionality and user experience
- Monitor extension performance

We do **not**:
- Sell your data to third parties
- Use data for advertising or marketing
- Use data for creditworthiness or lending decisions
- Share data with third parties except as described below

## Third-Party Services

### Sentry (Error Tracking)
We use [Sentry](https://sentry.io) to collect error reports and logs. Sentry receives:
- Anonymous user ID

## Data Storage and Retention
